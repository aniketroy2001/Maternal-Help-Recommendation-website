                    The nine months of pregnancy, as well as labor and delivery, are filled with many physical and psychological changes,
                     as well as changes in lifestyle. Each change poses a challenge 
                     that can be met successfully when the woman shares her feelings and experiences with a partner 
                     or other supportive person and with her physician, midwife, nurse, and childbirth educator.
                      The importance of health care throughout pregnancy is emphasized, 
                      because proper health care increases the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy, a healthy baby, 
                      and satisfied parents.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A maternal bond is the relationship between a mother and her child. 
            While typically associated with pregnancy and childbirth,
             a maternal bond may also develop in cases where the child is unrelated, such as an adoption.
            Both physical and emotional factors influence the mother-child bonding process.
             In separation anxiety disorder a child becomes fearful and nervous when away from a loved one, 
             usually a parent or other caregiver. New mothers do not always experience instant love toward their child.
              Instead, the bond can strengthen over time. Bonds can take hours, days, weeks, or months to develop.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A maternity hospital specializes in caring for women during pregnancy and childbirth.
             It also provides care for newborn infants, and may act as a centre for clinical training in midwifery and obstetrics.
              Formerly known as lying-in hospitals,
             most of them, like cottage hospitals, have been absorbed into larger general hospitals,
              where they operate as the maternity department.</p>
